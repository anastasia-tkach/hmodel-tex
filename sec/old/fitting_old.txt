As an example, let us consider a kinematic chain with the same degrees of freedoms as the thumb; see \Figure{kinematic}. Let us consider a point $\point$ expressed in the local coordinate frame $c$ (e.g. the tip of the thumb). By traversing the kinematic chain, its position in the wrist's local coordinate frame $w$ can be written as:
% 
\begin{equation*}
\tilde\point = \mathbf{T}_w^a\mathbf{R}_w^a(\delta_x, \delta_y, \delta_z)
           \mathbf{R}_a(\alpha_x, \alpha_y) 
           \mathbf{T}_a^b \mathbf{R}_b(\beta_x) 
           \mathbf{T}_b^c \mathbf{R}_c(\gamma_x)
           \point
\label{eq:kinematic}
\end{equation*}

\Anastasia{This looks equivalent to the formulation that I used, but I cannot guarantee without coding it up.}

Where, for example, $\mathbf{T}_a^b$ represents the homogeneous transformation matrix translating the coordinate frame $b$ to $a$, and the angles $\alpha_x, \beta_x, \gamma_x$ determine rotations about the local $x$ axis of $a, b, c$, that encode the thumb's \todo{flexion}, while $\alpha_y$ controls the thumb's \todo{abduction}. Note bone lengths have already been fitted, therefore $\mathbf{T}_*^*$ are not degrees of freedom in our optimization. For compactness of notation let us define the vector $\mathbf{\theta} = [\alpha_x, \alpha_y, \beta_x, \gamma_x ]$ of parameters that encode the hand \todo{pose}. The vector $\mathbf{\delta} = [\delta_x, \delta_y, \delta_z]$ gathers the parameters encoding the hand \todo{posture}, that is, its \emph{rest pose} of our hand. 
\Anastasia{I actually use 5 parameters $\delta$, not three. Because, at least in my hand, the upper phalanges of the fingers are slightly tilted sideways.}
The position $\point$ has been tracked over time across of number of frames $\{\point_1, \dots, \point_N\}$, leading to the following space-time optimization problem:
% 
\begin{eqnarray}
\argmin_{\mathbf{\delta}, \{\mathbf{\theta_i}\}} \sum_i^N \| \mathbf{\theta}_i \|^2 \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \| \tilde\point(\mathbf{\delta}, \mathbf{\theta}_i) - \point_i \|^2 = 0
\label{eq:kinopt}    
\end{eqnarray}

\Anastasia{
I solve a slightly different problem
\begin{eqnarray}
\argmin_{\mathbf{\delta}, \{\mathbf{\theta_i}\}} \sum_i^N \quad \| \tilde\point(\mathbf{\delta}, \mathbf{\theta}_i) - \point_i \|^2 = 0
\label{eq:kinopt}    
\end{eqnarray}
where $p_i$ are not only the fingertips, as you imply, but also the two upper finger joints.

Note that solving this problem does not only compute the rotations necessary to pose the model to a particular configuration. It also computes the parameters $\mathbf{\delta}$ of the optimal rotation frame.
