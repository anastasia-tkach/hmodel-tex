\paragraph{Limitations}


The topology of our template has been defined in a manual trial-and-error process. A more suitable topology can probably be found using an optimization process, possibly even adapting the topology for specific users, which would be an interesting avenue for future research.

Model calibration is currently done separately before the tracking starts. For certain consumer applications, it would be desirable to calibrate the model online during tracking, as recently proposed for face tracking systems~\cite{sofien, others}.
