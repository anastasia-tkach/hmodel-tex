\AT{Sentence from CONCERTO: ``The correspondences now contribute only a small computational cost to each iteration, comparing very favourably with ICP, where a 
closest-point operation must be performed on each iteration for each data point.'' For convtrack this is not a problem because it's very cheap, yet we can get a very good fitting model}

\AT{Something about the fact that rather than mentioning thresholds and values and gradients we just provide source code for it?}

% The core investigation in this paper is whether convolutional surfaces are a viable alternative for realtime hand tracking with single-view RBGD sensors. 
% Our hypothesis is that the increased geometry accuracy compared with cylinder models allows for a higher tracking precision without impairing the computational performance of the tracking algorithm.

\TODO{mention no need to re-init $\gg$FPS?}.

\Anastasia{Also, I think it is important to mention that in all the sequences the depth data is downsampled 4 times. Otherwise, the reviewers might say that our tracking looks better because the hand is very close to the sensor. It is close that that it can be seen better}
