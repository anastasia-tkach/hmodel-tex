\paragraph{Qualitative analysis}
\AT{Sentence from CONCERTO: ``The correspondences now contribute only a small computational cost to each iteration, comparing very favourably with ICP, where a closest-point operation must be performed on each iteration for each data point.'' For convtrack this is not a problem because it's very cheap, yet we can get a very good fitting model}
% 
\Anastasia{Maybe, this goes too far, but we might say that our model calibration has so little degrees of freedom compared to a triangles mesh, that it does not depend on a prior as heavily as triangular mesh-based systems. Those systems cannot work without a prior - too many degrees of freedom. And a prior means acquiring a database of hands. Not any research team can accomplish that.}

\paragraph{Calibration}
\Anastasia{The calibration is still not perfect, there is several components to it, centers position, initial transformations, joint limits and PCA (initial transformations, joint limits and PCA seem to be similar for all humans, but in a perfect world we could try to optimize for all of them).  Every time I improve one of these components, the tracking is getting better. I can see that there is still room for improvement. (Because our data source is not good and our calibration is just the first attempt.) But every improvement in calibration leads to a better tracking.}

\paragraph{Generative tracker}
We would like to stress that our real-time tracking algorithm is \emph{purely} generative, yet we demonstrated it yields unprecedented robustness to tracking failure. We believe this is due to the ability to optimize at a constant 60Hz rate, and to the quality of the calibrated model. Currently the only sequences that incur in loss-of-tracking are the ones reported in our limitations \videoLimit{}.

\TODO{mention no need to re-init $\gg$FPS?}.
\Anastasia{We can stress again that we do not have re-initialization not because it is somehow fundamentally impossible in our method, but because we want to demonstrate how good our tracking is. It basically only brakes in limitation cases (fast motion, other objects, rotating thumb, out of sensor range.) For that we could totally add some powerful re-initialization to make the system even more robust.}
\Anastasia{Also, I think we could mention that our system can be optimized to 120 FPS maybe? The tracking quality degrades with speed of motion, that is with number of frames per some ``quantity of motion''. With faster frame rate the system will definitely get better.}

\paragraph{Downsampling}
% \Anastasia{Also, I think it is important to mention that in all the sequences the depth data is downsampled 4 times. Otherwise, the reviewers might say that our tracking looks better because the hand is very close to the sensor. It is close than that it can be seen better}
While the \realsense{} sensor is a short range camera, notice in this work we have downsampled the depth image 4 times to \todo{QVGA} format with a median filter, giving an average of \todo{10000} pixels/frame for optimization; note this is approximatively the number of samples found on a hand in long-range cameras. The recent work of \cite{taylor2016concerto} reports a total of 192 pixels/frame, therefore enabling multi-CPU performance without loss of tracking precision. Inspired by this work, we have experimented with further downsampling and reached analogous conclusions. However, the computational bottleneck of the \emph{htrack} system we extend lies in the overhead caused by render/compute context switching. While this is currently an issue, we would like to note that this problem will disappear with the adoption of (OpenGL4.3)~\emph{compute shaders}.

\paragraph{Reproducibility}
% 
The weights of energy terms used in tracking and calibration optimizations have been identified by manually tweaking the runtime until our tracker reached the desired performance level. We do not believe reporting the values for such weights here to be particularly meaningful. However, we adhere to the \emph{LGPL} requirements of the \emph{htrack} system, and (upon acceptance) release our source code with parameters, datasets, as well as the specification of the energy gradients required for optimization. This will ensure full reproducibility of our work.
