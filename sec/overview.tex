%The main  we investigate in this paper is whether convolutional surfaces are a viable alternative for realtime hand tracking with
%single-view RBGD sensors. 
%
%Our hypothesis is that the increased geometry accuracy compared with cylinder models allows for a higher tracking precision without impairing the computational performance of the tracking algorithm.
%
%Essential for accurate tracking is sufficiently precise modeling of the hand geometry of the user. This requires a geometric representation that on the 
%
%
%The model is flexible in that it can easily be adapted to a specific user.
