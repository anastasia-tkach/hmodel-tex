\caption{(left) Tracking when the model from \protect\cite{tagliasacchi2015robust} is used without proper coarse scale calibration. (middle) A roughly manually calibrated model can help increasing the fitting fidelity, but tuning becomes increasingly difficult with more degrees of freedom. (right) The proposed automatically calibrated model. \AT{...I am wondering whether we should keep the model the same color of htrack... it is difficult to see as data is the same color as the model!!!}}
