\caption{Three side-by-side comparisons of tracking performance from the ``dataset/seq1'' test sequence. Our model allows us to obtain much higher tracking quality, as measured by the metric reported in the top-left of each frame. (middle) The motion can be recovered at a finer scale, thus preventing model-based solutions from incurring in tracking failure.}}
