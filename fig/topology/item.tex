\caption{(left) the underlying skeleton $\skeleton$ that parametrizes the convolution surfaces and a representation of the radii defined at each vertex, solid parts are shown in dark green, articulated parts in purple and elastic parts in light green.
 (right) the surface $\surface$ can be ray-traced in the fragment shader, triangulated or rendered as a set of capsule models \Figure{convsurf}-(right). \TODO{anastasia: only have 2x rendering -- the two in the left column to be precise. Also it would be a good idea to change the colors of segments v.s. spheres, no?} \TODO{color-code rigid parts of topology, and mention it in the caption} }
