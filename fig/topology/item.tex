(left) the underlying skeleton $\skeleton$ that parametrizes the convolution surfaces and a representation of the radii defined at each vertex, solid parts are shown in dark green, articulated parts in purple and elastic parts in light green.

(right) the surface $\surface$ can be ray-traced in the fragment shader, triangulated or rendered as a set of capsule models \Figure{convsurf}-(right).
