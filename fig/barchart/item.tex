Aggregated 2D/3D tracking performance metrics of our method compared to \protect\cite{tagliasacchi2015robust} for the \todo{\textbf{14?}} sequences in \Figure{motiontypes}. Our calibrated convolution model often helps the generative  technique from incurring in loss-of-tracking, these are visualized are spike in the errors in the per-frame plots reported in the additional material.
