\caption{In a monocular RGBD sensor only the front-facing part of the model should be registered to the data. Here the camera is observing (left to right) two 2D convolution elements and the visible parts of the model are color-coded. Correspondences whose normal point away from the camera ought to be discarded, and replaced by the closest amongst silhouette correspondences or front-facing portions of wedges.}
